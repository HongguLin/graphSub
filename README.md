graphSub is a re-usable D3 force directed graph for displaying
subsets of a much larger graph. This has the benefits of presenting
a graph which is easier to understand and navigable whilst still 
giving access to the entire dataset.

Featues include:
* None over lapping labels.
* You can configure how wide the subset is.
* Clickable nodes which redraw the graph centered on the clicked node.
* Smooth transitions which fade in/out only the new nodes and links.
