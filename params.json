This has the benefits of presenting\r\na graph which is easier to understand and navigable whilst still \r\ngiving access to the entire dataset.\r\n\r\nFeatues include:\r\n* None over lapping labels.\r\n* You can configure how wide the subset is.\r\n* Clickable nodes which redraw the graph centered on the clicked node.\r\n* Smooth transitions which fade in/out only the new nodes and links. \r\n\r\nExample bl.ock.s used in the development of this graph:\r\n\r\n[Simple example of reusable d3 plugin](http://bl.ocks.org/cpbotha/5073718)\r\n\r\n[Force-based label placement](http://bl.ocks.org/MoritzStefaner/1377729)\r\n\r\n[Force-Directed Graph](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045)\r\n\r\n[General Update Pattern, I](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218)\r\n\r\n[General Update Pattern, II](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808221)\r\n\r\n[General Update Pattern, III](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808234)\r\n\r\n[Animating Changes in Force Diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/ericcoopey/6c602d7cb14b25c179a4)","google":"UA-39390892-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
